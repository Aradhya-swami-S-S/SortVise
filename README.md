## 🧠 How It Works

- Bars are represented as `<div>` elements with dynamic heights.
- When a sorting algorithm is selected:
  - Bars are highlighted using colors:  
    - 🔴 Red and Yelow: comparing  
    - 🟢 Dark Green: sorted  
    - 🟦 Turquoise: default
  - Swaps are animated using height exchanges with `setTimeout()` and `async/await`.
